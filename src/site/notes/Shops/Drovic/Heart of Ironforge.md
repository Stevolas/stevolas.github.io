# Heart of Ironforge

#### History

[[Character's/PC's/Zipleze Rimmore\|Zipleze]] bought some steel and an unfinished returning shield from [[Dunar\|Dunar]], the shopkeeper and owner of Heart of Ironforge. The party then proceeded to offload a bunch of old swords and weaponry to him.

#### Highlights

- [[Character's/PC's/Freya Lorhalien\|Freya]] asked [[Character's/PC's/Zipleze Rimmore\|Zipleze]] for a dagger for undisclosed reasons, before selling it immediately to Dunar for a measly 5 gold.
