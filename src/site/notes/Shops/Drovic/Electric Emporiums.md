# Electric Emporiums

#### History

[[Lothar\|Lothar]], a halfling male, sold the party some magical items before the King's Ball in [[Locations/Metropolis/Drovic\|Drovic]]. These included the Lantern of Revealing for [[Character's/PC's/Hayn Underfoot\|Hayn]], Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments for [[Character's/PC's/Tarin Bolirahn\|Tarin]], and a Ring of Protection for [[Character's/PC's/Freya Lorhalien\|Freya]].

#### Highlights

- [[Character's/PC's/Hayn Underfoot\|Hayn]] managed to get a discount after persuading [[Lothar\|Lothar]] to give him one "for a brother (halfling)". Also acquired a free forgery kit from him.
- [[Character's/PC's/Freya Lorhalien\|Freya]] managed to trick her way into paying half price for the Ring of Protection with a sob story.
