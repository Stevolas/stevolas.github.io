# Mask
#### History

Mask appeared before [[Hayn\|Hayn]] as a small halfling man during their visit to [[Locations/Cities/Anaheim\|Anaheim]], after knowledge of his brother [[Eran Underfoot\|Eran]]'s appearance in the city. Mask had enlisted the party to break into a vault, belonging to [[Vidorant\|Vidorant]], and retrieve a relic known as [[The World\|The World]] - a palm sized globe with the ability to temporarily control the flow of time. After successfully stealing the globe, the party attempted to sneak out of the city when he reappeared to the party. He said that he would allow the party to keep it, but that they must not allow it to get into the hands of [[Character's/NPC's/Gods/Cyric\|Cyric]].
