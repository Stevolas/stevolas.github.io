#### History

She sold the party a few potions, namely a couple potions of animal speaking, greater healing potions, and speed potions. Before the party left, she mentioned to [[Arthur\|Arthur]] that [[Quests/Misc/Investigate Fish Folk in Drovic\|Fish Folk]] took over the docks, where she would normally obtain clam tongue - an ingredient needed for a potion of giant size.
