# Craig
#### History

Craig is a traveling merchant that [[Factions/Bad Company\|Bad Company]] occasionally stumble into. 

Stumbled across Craig again outside Covin on the parties way to Drovic. He sold the party many goods, including a sword for Hayn, shield for Arthur, goggles for Zipleze, cloak for Armmyr, armour of weightlessness for Freya, a puzzler's ring for Tarin, and some extra potions for the party.
