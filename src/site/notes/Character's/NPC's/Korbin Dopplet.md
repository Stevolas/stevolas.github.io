# Korbin Dopplet
#### History

Korbin is the brother of [[Character's/PC's/Armmyr Dopplet\|Armmyr Dopplet]]. At some point, Korbin managed to get bit by a werewolf - contracting lycanthropy. The party managed to cure him of his affliction. The party met up with Korbin again at [[Locations/Cities/Irridanel\|Irridanel]], during the crisis at Mount Franz and subsequent battle with [[Inchcomb\|Inchcomb]]. Korbin is now an impromptu leader of Irridanel.
