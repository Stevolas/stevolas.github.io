# Kent
#### History

Kent, the Red Skull Bounty Hunter, was a former associate of [[Character's/PC's/Hayn Underfoot\|Hayn Underfoot]]. Hayn's brother [[Eran Underfoot\|Eran Underfoot]] died after Hayn gave Kent information on some valuables in Eran's possession.

He later reappeared in Drovic, appearing as a unknown bounty hunter ambushing Hayn and [[Character's/PC's/Arthur Maynard\|Arthur Maynard]] after their search for a hidden smuggled object. During the ensuing fight, Kent took a civilian hostage before falling unconcious from an airborne attack from Hayn. After finding out of Kent's identity, he and Arthur traveled outside of Drovic, planning to interrogate him at their fort just outside the city.

#### Highlights

- Killed [[Character's/PC's/Hayn Underfoot\|Hayn Underfoot]]'s [[Character's/NPC's/Miscellaneous Characters#^Eran\|Eran]].
- Knocked out in Drovic by Hayn.
