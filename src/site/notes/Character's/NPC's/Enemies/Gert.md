# Gert
#### History

The party encountered Gert outside of Drovic, after he and a group of men attempted to kill the "merchant" Antony, whom was attempting to scam the party with bad goods. Gert had bought an "enhancement" potion from him, which did not work in the bedroom. A letter was found on him that mentioned that [[Asmodeous\|Asmodeous]]'s (the king of hell and god of indulgence) mount Twilight Phoenix is real.

Gert was last seen running back into Drovic, after his defeat by the party.
