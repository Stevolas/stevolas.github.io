# Epiphren Ramsey
#### History

The party first met Epiphren in [[Locations/Villages/Vindor\|Vindor]], where the majority of the party first came together. There, he helped the party until a large force of Orc's began pillaging from the [[Wild Lands\|Wild Lands]], to the north; Here, he split from the party, his fate unknown until they met with him again.

Epiphren now primarily stays in the small community of [[Locations/Hamlet/Boab\|Boab]], where he assists the community using his unusual strength.
