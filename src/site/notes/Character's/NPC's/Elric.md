# Elric
#### History

[[Factions/Bad Company\|Bad Company]] first came across Elric on their way to the city of [[Locations/Metropolis/Brass\|Brass]]. Elric was being attacked by creatures while he attempted to retrieve a bag he had hidden in the area. After defeating them, Elric gave the party assistance in entering the city, and getting them to someone who may know information on [[Dawnbringer\|Dawnbringer]], as-well as the piece of [[Godsbane\|Godsbane]].

At one point, Elric brought the party back to his home, and they met his mother - whom was suffering from a genetic disease. Arthur proceeded to heal her of her affliction with his Lay on Hands, and they mentioned the possibility of helping Elric escape the [[Elemental Plane of Fire\|Elemental Plane of Fire]] on their way out.
