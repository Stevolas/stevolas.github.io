# Irygl
#### History

The party first encountered Irygl when searching for her in search of a cure for the plague surrounding Vindor. Eventually they learn that the pestilence was caused by [[Character's/NPC's/Enemies/Orcus\|Orcus]], and to defeat him they must rebuild the weapon known as [[Godsbane\|Godsbane]]. She would help the party on their journey, until eventually settling in the small forest village of [[Locations/Hamlet/Boab\|Boab]].
