# Tarin Bolirahn
#### History

Tarin Bolirahn met with [[Character's/PC's/Armmyr Dopplet\|Armmyr Dopplet]] on the road to Vindor, in search of answers about the disappearance of his hometown - [[Locations/Hamlet/Boab\|Boab]] - as-well as a search for his partner [[Character's/NPC's/Atlas\|Atlas]]. Alongside Armmyr, he and a few others would form an adventuring party - that would later be known as [[Factions/Bad Company\|Bad Company]] - to help with a plague effecting Vindor. He formed an adversarial relationship with [[Character's/NPC's/Leo Denteli\|Leo Denteli]], whom was the cause of Boab's disappearance, before making peace with him after the revelation of his enthrallment.
