# Tarin Bolirahn
#### History
Tarin Bolirahn met with [[Character's/PC's/Armmyr Dopplet\|Armmyr Dopplet]] on the road to Vindor, in search of answers about the disappearance of his hometown - [[Locations/Hamlet/Boab\|Boab]] - as-well as a search for his partner [[Character's/NPC's/Atlas\|Atlas]]. Alongside Armmyr, he and a few others would form an adventuring party - that would later be known as [[Factions/Bad Company\|Bad Company]] - to help with a plague effecting Vindor. He would later form an adversarial relationship with [[Character's/NPC's/Leo Denteli\|Leo Denteli]], whom caused the disappearance of Boab, before making peace with him after the revelation of his enthrallment. After rescuing Atlas, he would continue traveling with the party in search of fragments of the legendary [[Godsbane\|Godsbane]], in order to defeat [[Character's/NPC's/Enemies/Orcus\|Orcus]].
