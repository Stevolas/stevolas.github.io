# Hayn Underfoot
#### History
Hayn was born alongside twin [[Eran Underfoot \|Eran]] in the town of Vindor. Despite similar environments, Eran would grow up to become a well respected, small time merchant in Vindor. Dissimilarly, Hayn grew up a peddler of illegal goods, a pickpocket, and a thief. Eventually, at behest of a lord of Vindor, he alongside a few others formed a party to attend to an issue effecting the region. Eventually, this party would form into the adventuring party [[Factions/Bad Company\|Bad Company]].

#### Highlights
- God of Thieves, Mask, provided a job to retrieve an artifact called The Globe.
- Hayn was chosen by the Matron of Ravens, providing him a touch of magic.
