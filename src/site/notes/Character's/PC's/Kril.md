# Kril
#### History

Little is known on Kril, except that he eventually found shelter inside the vast tunnel system in [[Mount Franz\|Mount Franz]]. The party, [[Bad  Company\|Bad  Company]], would eventually stumble upon him on their trek up the mountain in search of [[Character's/NPC's/Enemies/Bento\|Bento]] and [[Character's/NPC's/Leo Denteli\|Leo Denteli]]. Having been injured by Leo on their way up the mountain, he agreed to help the party up the mountain, and escorted them through the tunnels and to the peak. There, they fought Bento and Leo, whereupon he left the party, closing a portal to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire\|Elemental Plane of Fire]] as the rest of them went inside in search of the sword [[Dawnbringer\|Dawnbringer]] and a fragment of [[Godsbane\|Godsbane]].

#### Highlights

- Ripped [[Character's/NPC's/Enemies/Orcus\|Orcus]]'s horn from Leo's head, freeing him of his enthrallment.
- Stayed behind to close the portal into the Elemental Plane of Fire.
