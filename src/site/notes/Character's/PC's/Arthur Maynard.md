# Arthur Maynard
#### History
Arthur was born to [[Abigail Maynard\|Abigail Maynard]]. During an attack, his future adopted father [[Character's/NPC's/Morvello\|Morvello]] found them. After her death, Morvello took Arthur under the tutelage of himself and the [[Factions/Paladin Order of Cape Renozo\|Paladin Order]] of [[Locations/Cities/Cape Renozo\|Cape Renozo]]. Taking on an Oath of Devotion under the god [[Heironeous\|Heironeous]], he would eventually make his way to [[Locations/Villages/Vindor\|Vindor]] and join up with a group of adventurers, later becoming known as [[Factions/Bad Company\|Bad Company]]. He was killed in a fight against [[Inchcomb\|Inchcomb]] before being brought back to life via [[Character's/PC's/Barnar Dankil\|Barnar Dankil]]'s revivify spell, but in the process lost an eye and had the side of his face scarred.
#### Highlights
- Fought his mother, whom turned into a giant snake due to a curse, during her attack on [[Locations/Cities/Cape Renozo\|Cape Renozo]]. Subsequently ended [[Character's/NPC's/Morvello\|Morvello]]'s curse that was cast on him from his mother.
- Abandoned his oath under [[Heironeous\|Heironeous]], finding new purpose with an Oath of Redemption under the god [[Sarenrae\|Sarenrae]].
- Lost an eye in the fight against [[Inchcomb\|Inchcomb]].
