# Freya Lorhalien
#### History

Bad Company first stumbled across Freya at [[The Spire\|The Spire]], located in the north-east of [[Franzictini\|Franzictini]]. Cowering after being shunted through a portal by her parents, the party brought her along with them - hoping to get her back to the Fey and back home. Eventually the party would have to travel through the Fey, where they found her village burnt to the ground. After an encounter with (forgot), she gained the ability from a powerful Ent, which allows her to plant seeds in various dimensions; These seeds would allow for travel between the dimensions.

The party eventually split when half jumped into the portal on top of [[Mount Franz\|Mount Franz]], which led to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire\|Elemental Plane of Fire]]. She would remain with [[Character's/PC's/Zipleze Rimmore\|Zipleze Rimmore]] in [[Locations/Cities/Irridanel\|Irridanel]], where the two would disagree on the feasibility of [[Inchcomb\|Inchcomb]]'s idea of transferring his mind to a robotic body. After Inchcomb turned evil and effectively destroyed Irridanel - in the process slaughtering many innocents - Freya would loathe Zipleze for what he helped cause.

#### Highlights

- Killed by a bugbear during a fight in the underdark under Covin, and subsequently resurrected by Barnar.
